# dice-recognizer
A Python dice recognizer script that uses OpenCV to detect and count the number of pips (dots) on the faces of 6-sided dice in a video stream from a webcam.

This script recognizes 6 sided dice with pips, either a single die or multiple dice, counts the number of pips on each dice face and displays the total number rolled. It is built to account for variable lighting if the camera has the ability to focus and applies some basic preprocessing on the frame by first gray scale the image, then applie a Gaussian blur to improve the thresholding and contours. The bounding boxes are actually used to detect the dice frames and later the bounding circles for visual representation of what was actually detected. This script seems to work well with various dice of multiple colors and sizes (including translucent dice that throw off weird reflections). There is a second window for settings and trackbars to adjust the settings in real time to aid with calibration in various lighting environments. I keep it around 0.8 or 0.9 depending on the lighting. The default threshold for circularity is 0.6. Note: the detection happens with rectangular bounding boxes because it's more accurate, the circular bounding boxes are drawn to show what was detected to the user and should be on the edges of the pips. The program was tested with dice that have white pips. Press q to quit.
